# image_processing_tutorial
this project is like an opencv image processing guide. this project contains about 35 different options to play with. just simply enter the location of the image and play with the 35 different options
some of them are basic viewing in grayscale,rgb,bgr,lab etc.
there are two negative images; one in colour and another in grayscale
there are three images for the blue, green and red channels for the input colour image.
the canny edge detection along with a dilated and eroded image is also available
there are a lot of colormaps available in this project.
